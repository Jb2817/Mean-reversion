While this is a start to a strategy please note:
1) Model always holds a position, you can edit this logic so the model can hold 0 position (neutral)
2) Other relevant statistics such as Sharpe, annualized returns, annualized vol, and max drawdowns among others are not calculated here and provide crucial information regarding the ability of your overall strategy
3) Transactions cost aren't calculated, but a simple edit to the returns column and you'll be fine
